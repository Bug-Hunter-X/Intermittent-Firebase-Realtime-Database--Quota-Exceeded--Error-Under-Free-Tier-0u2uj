# Intermittent Firebase Realtime Database 'Quota Exceeded' Error Under Free Tier

This repository demonstrates a problem where the Firebase Realtime Database throws a `Quota exceeded` error despite being well within the free tier limits.  The error is sporadic and lacks specific information regarding which operation caused it.

## Bug Description
The Firebase Realtime Database intermittently throws a `FirebaseError: Quota exceeded` error. This occurs even when the application's data usage and operations are far below the free tier limits. The error message provides little to no context on the specific operation or data that triggered the quota issue. This makes debugging and resolving the issue incredibly difficult.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase using `npm install firebase`.
3. Replace placeholders in `bug.js` with your Firebase configuration.
4. Run `node bug.js`. The script performs simple read and write operations.
5. Observe that after multiple runs the script will throw a `Quota Exceeded` error despite likely being well under the free tier limit.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing robust error handling and monitoring. The provided `bugSolution.js` shows how to enhance error handling and logging to gain better insights into the problematic operation.

The root cause of this error is often complex and not consistently reproducible. It could be related to temporary backend issues, aggressive background processes, or even unexpected database operations.

Note: This bug report provides a demonstration of the error, while it's likely a transient issue, the root cause needs investigation on a case-by-case basis.
